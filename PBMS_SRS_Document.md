# Parking Building Management System

## Software Requirements Specification

Version 1.4 - REVIEW

This Tier 2 SRS defines the PBMS release baseline after the scope decisions in CR-GEN-003. Current code remains implementation evidence, but the direct product decisions in Section 17 take precedence where remediation or removal is required. An implemented UI without a compatible API, or an API without a completed and authorized release surface, is not claimed as a completed current capability.

### 1.6 Document Overview

Sections 2 through 8 define context, actors, features, use cases, rules, and functional requirements. Sections 9 through 14 define data, interfaces, quality, access, states, and errors. Sections 15 through 22 define verification, traceability, governance, conventions, review, and approval.

## 2. Overall Description

> Last Updated: 2026-07-20 | Status: REVIEW | Author: PBMS Analysis Team

### 2.1 Product Perspective

PBMS is a browser-based parking-management product composed of a Next.js web client and an ASP.NET Core REST API using Clean Architecture and PostgreSQL.

#### 2.1.1 System Boundary

The PBMS boundary includes web role workspaces, API controllers, application services, domain rules, persistence, background workers, and external-service adapters. VNPay, Google, SMTP, Plate Recognizer, camera hardware, and the browser runtime are outside that boundary.

#### 2.1.2 Context Diagram

### 2.2 Product Functions

PBMS maintains accounts, vehicles, facilities, bookings, sessions, prices, payments, text-only incidents, cards, blacklists, revenue reports, and audit records. It supports gate OCR with manual fallback and runs approved expiry cleanup automatically.

### 2.3 User Classes And Characteristics

| User class | Characteristics and responsibility |
|---|---|
| Guest | Registers, verifies registration email, and signs in. |
| Driver | Manages own vehicles, bookings, sessions, payments, and history. |
| Staff | Operates entry/exit, card, incident, and blacklist activities. |
| Manager | Manages facilities, pricing, operations, and reports. |
| Admin | Manages accounts, configuration, audit, and selected master/operational data. |
| System | Executes approved non-human scheduled booking and pricing-policy cleanup. |

### 2.4 Operating Environment

| Component | Current baseline |
|---|---|
| Web | Next.js 15.1.6, React 18.3.1, TypeScript 5.7.2, Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 |
| API | .NET 10 and ASP.NET Core controllers |
| Persistence | EF Core 10, Npgsql, PostgreSQL |
| Identity | JWT bearer, BCrypt, Google identity |
| Cache/integration | StackExchange Redis package, SMTP, VNPay, Plate Recognizer |

### 2.5 Design And Implementation Constraints

- Camera capture requires browser media permission and a secure context except localhost.
- PostgreSQL must support `btree_gist` for the slot-booking exclusion constraint.
- Frontend route guards are not an authorization boundary.
- External credentials and secrets must not remain in production source configuration.
- Frontend API base URL must match backend `/api` controller routes.
- Current active pricing uses `IPricingCalculationService` and the domain `PricingEngine`; Grace Period must be applied there before the legacy fee service is retired.

### 2.6 Assumptions And Dependencies

- Master data and role data exist before operations begin.
- Staff can correct or manually enter a plate when OCR is unavailable or inaccurate.
- VNPay settlement depends on valid signed gateway data.
- Current code behavior may contain gaps; this SRS exposes those gaps and does not silently promote them to approved requirements.

| PostgreSQL | Two-way | Persistent source of truth | Controlled API failure; recovery policy is open |

## 4. Business Context

> Last Updated: 2026-07-20 | Status: REVIEW | Author: PBMS Analysis Team

### 4.1 Problem Statement

Parking operations require consistent capacity control, reservation, gate processing, pricing, payment, incident handling, and accountability across several roles. Manual or fragmented handling creates conflicts, incorrect fees, slow exits, and weak auditability.

### 4.2 Business Goals

| Goal ID | Goal |
|---|---|
| BG-001 | Prevent conflicting bookings and active resource assignments. |
| BG-002 | Reduce gate-processing effort while retaining staff verification. |
| BG-003 | Calculate transparent charges from active policies and incidents. |
| BG-004 | Preserve payment and operational traceability. |
| BG-005 | Give managers current capacity, revenue, and audit information. |
| BG-006 | Enforce role and ownership boundaries at the server. |

### 4.3 Success Criteria

| Criterion ID | Measure |
|---|---|
| SC-001 | Concurrent requests persist no overlapping active booking for the same concrete slot. |
| SC-002 | Each completed session has a consistent vehicle, card, allocation, charge, and payment outcome. |
| SC-003 | Revenue queries include only PAID payments and use UTC+7 business dates. |
| SC-004 | Every Must requirement has passing automated or approved manual evidence. |
| SC-005 | Anonymous, wrong-role, and wrong-owner tests pass for every non-public endpoint before production. |

### 4.4 Current Workflow

Drivers can register, book, pay deposits, view parking data, and submit text-only incidents. Staff operate entry and exit. Managers configure facilities and pricing. PBMS calculates charges and records payment. System performs approved expiry cleanup. The implementation gaps against this decided baseline are listed in Section 17 and `PBMS_Remediation_Decision_Report.md`.

### 4.5 Target Workflow

The accepted target uses direct-JWT login, completes password recovery, activates Grace Period in the current Pricing Engine, enforces server authorization, and logs committed price calculations. Refund, Monthly Subscription, user Notification, incident file upload, automatic API retry, and Shift Report are excluded as specified by CR-GEN-003.

### 6.2 Use Case Details

#### UC-ACC-001 Register And Authenticate

- **Preconditions**: Email and username are not already used for registration; external identity is valid when Google is selected.
- **Trigger**: Guest submits registration or login.
- **Main flow**: PBMS sends/verifies registration OTP, creates a verified account, validates password or Google identity, and issues a JWT session directly without a login-OTP challenge.
- **Alternatives**: Duplicate identity, expired/incorrect OTP, failed Google verification, or invalid credentials are rejected.
- **Postconditions**: A verified account or authenticated session exists; otherwise no invalid account/session is created.

#### UC-ACC-002 Recover Password

- **Preconditions**: User is on the forgot-password route.
- **Trigger**: User submits email, OTP, and new password.
- **Main flow**: PBMS accepts a recovery request with a generic response, verifies a recovery-specific OTP, issues a short-lived single-use recovery token, and consumes it to store a new BCrypt password hash.
- **Gap**: The current frontend uses registration OTP endpoints and calls an absent reset endpoint. AUTH-02 in `PBMS_Remediation_Decision_Report.md` must be completed before acceptance.
- **Postconditions**: After remediation, the old password fails, the new password succeeds, and the recovery token cannot be replayed.

#### UC-DRV-001 Manage Vehicle

- **Preconditions**: Driver is authenticated.
- **Trigger**: Driver creates, updates, lists, or removes a vehicle.
- **Main flow**: PBMS validates vehicle type and normalized plate and persists the driver's vehicle.
- **Postconditions**: Vehicle data is available to booking and gate operations.

#### UC-STR-001 Manage Parking Structure

- **Primary actors**: Manager, Admin.
- **Main flow**: Maintain Building, Floor, Zone, and ParkingSlot hierarchy; configure vehicle type, booking limit, and operational slot state.
- **Postconditions**: Capacity and availability queries reflect active structure data.

#### UC-BOOK-001 Create And Pay Booking

- **Preconditions**: Driver, vehicle, building, time interval, and capacity are valid.
- **Main flow**: PBMS checks lead time, duration, conflicts, and capacity; creates Pending booking; creates estimated deposit; confirms after payment.
- **Alternatives**: Cars may select an available slot from the selected building/floor map; motorbikes use a general zone without a concrete slot; expired unpaid bookings are processed by System; cancellation changes Booking state without initiating a refund.
- **Postconditions**: Booking is Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled, Expired, CheckedIn, or NoShow.

#### UC-OPS-001 Check In And Allocate

- **Primary actor**: Staff.
- **Main flow**: Capture or enter plate, optionally use OCR, validate booking/vehicle/card/blacklist/resource conditions, allocate zone or slot, and create an active session.
- **Postconditions**: Vehicle, card, allocation, optional booking, entry image, and staff actor are linked consistently.

#### UC-SESSION-001 View Or Extend Session

- **Primary actors**: Driver, Staff.
- **Main flow**: Query current session and price estimate; extend eligible session after validating overlap/capacity rules.

#### UC-OPS-002 Check Out Vehicle

- **Primary actor**: Staff.
- **Main flow**: Identify active session, capture/verify exit plate, calculate final charge and penalties, settle payment or record unpaid exit, then release card and allocation.
- **Alternatives**: Plate mismatch, lost card, and lost-card rollback require controlled handling.

#### UC-PRICE-001 Manage Pricing Policy

- **Primary actors**: Manager and Admin for human actions; System for scheduled expiry.
- **Main flow**: Manager/Admin creates, edits, activates, and maintains vehicle-type policies and windows including Priority. System runs `ExpiredPricingPolicyCleanupWorker` every 12 hours to deactivate expired active policies.
- **Constraint**: Staff does not administer policies. Current `PricingPolicy` has `VehicleTypeId` and no `BuildingId`.

#### UC-PRICE-002 Calculate Parking Charge

- **Primary actor**: PBMS.
- **Main flow**: Select applicable policy, apply base/increment/Grace Period/cap rules and eligible incident penalties, and return a breakdown. Persist a calculation log when the result creates or changes a payable amount.
- **Alternative**: Missing or false `APPLY_SEGMENTED_PRICING` keeps non-segmented policy selection.

#### UC-PAY-001 Complete Payment

- **Main flow**: Create payment; complete cash immediately or verify VNPay; invalidate older pending duplicates.
- **Postconditions**: Payment state and associated booking/session are consistent.

#### UC-INC-001 Handle Incident And Restriction

- **Main flow**: Driver may report a text description for an active owned-vehicle session using any active Incident Type returned by PBMS; authorized operational users maintain incidents, penalties, card status, and blacklists and apply current restrictions during gate/pricing operations.
- **Constraint**: The current release accepts no image, file, filename, evidence URL, or attachment. PBMS must validate active type and session ownership on the server.

#### UC-RPT-001 Monitor, Report, And Audit

- **Main flow**: Query operational summaries, calculate revenue from PAID payments using UTC+7 groupings, and review permitted audit records.

#### UC-RPT-002 Submit And Review Shift Report

- **Status**: DEPRECATED for the current release.
- **Reason**: Shift Report and shift handover are not exposed, executed, diagrammed, or accepted in this release. Backend code may remain only as non-exposed future code.

#### UC-MONTH-001 Purchase Monthly Subscription

- **Status**: DEPRECATED.
- **Reason**: Product decision requires complete project removal rather than continued compatibility. Historical IDs remain reserved for traceability.

#### UC-SEC-001 Manage Role Permissions

- **Primary actor**: Admin.
- **Main flow**: Admin views stable Permission codes, changes RolePermission mappings, and PBMS validates and persists the mapping before invalidating or versioning the authorization cache.
- **Constraint**: PBMS must preserve at least one Admin access path capable of managing role permissions.
- **Postconditions**: Subsequent non-public requests are allowed only when the authenticated role has the endpoint Permission and any required resource ownership check passes.

### 7.2 Business Rule Details

#### Booking Timing Decision Table

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| Start is less than 15 minutes away | Reject creation |
| Duration is less than 4 hours | Reject creation |
| Pending payment exceeds 15 minutes | System expires booking |
| Confirmed booking exceeds check-in plus 30 minutes | System marks no-show |
| Pending or Confirmed Booking is eligible for cancellation | Booking becomes Cancelled; no refund state is created |

#### Pricing Selection Order

When segmented pricing is enabled, PBMS selects applicable vehicle-type policies by Priority descending, EffectiveStart descending, then identifier descending. PBMS applies configured Grace Period in the active Pricing Engine before charging the next increment block. Policy administration is performed by Manager/Admin. `ExpiredPricingPolicyCleanupWorker` is System behavior, not Staff behavior.

#### Deprecated Rule Families

BR-SHIFT-001 through BR-SHIFT-005, BR-MONTH-001 through BR-MONTH-024, and BR-PAY-003 remain reserved and DEPRECATED. Historical or removed rule IDs must not be reassigned.

#### 9.2.2 Conceptual Relationship Summary

Building contains Floors; Floor contains Zones; Zone contains ParkingSlots. Account owns Vehicles and Bookings. Booking references Vehicle, Building, VehicleType, and optional Slot. ParkingSession references vehicle, card, allocation, optional booking, in/out Staff, payments, and incidents. PricingPolicy applies to VehicleType and owns windows/rules. A committed PricingCalculationLog references its applicable Booking, ParkingSession, and Payment.

### 9.3 Logical And Physical Model

#### 9.3.1 Modeling Rules

- Integer identifiers are persistence keys unless code defines otherwise.
- Referential relationships must resolve to active permitted records.
- Multiple entities implement soft delete; normal queries must exclude deleted rows where configured.
- Business timestamps and UTC+7 conversions must not be mixed without an explicit boundary.

#### 9.3.2 Physical Tables

Physical EF Core tables must correspond to the active entities above after remediation. `MonthlySubscription`, `SubscriptionPriceConfig`, and related keys are removal-migration targets and must not remain for compatibility. `ShiftReport` and `Notification` may remain only as excluded future/backend-only tables. `RevenueStatistic` is not an active reporting source.

#### 9.3.3 Physical Table Columns

| Entity | Business-critical fields |
|---|---|
| Account | Id, Username, Email, PasswordHash, RoleId, status/verification fields |
| Vehicle | Id, AccountId, VehicleTypeId, LicensePlate, NormalizedLicensePlate |
| Booking | Id, account/vehicle/building/type/optional slot, planned times, deadline, status |
| ParkingSession | Id, vehicle/card/booking/allocation, check-in/out, Staff IDs, images, status |
| PricingPolicy | Id, VehicleTypeId, Priority, effective dates, active state |
| Payment | Id, BookingId/SessionId, amount, method, Pending/Paid/Failed status, gateway/order data |
| PricingCalculationLog | Purpose, related Booking/Session/Payment identifiers, policy, interval, total, breakdown, timestamp, correlation key |
| ParkingSystemConfig | Key, typed/configured value, state metadata |

#### 9.3.4 Relationship Summary From Physical Tables

Foreign keys implement the conceptual relationships. Application validation supplements database constraints for configurable buffer/capacity and active-resource rules.

#### 9.3.5 Mermaid ERD With Physical Tables

The maintainable full physical ERD is referenced in Section 18.2 rather than duplicated here. The conceptual ERD above is normative for scope; EF configurations and migrations are normative for current physical details.

#### 9.3.6 Cross-Domain Constraints

- `NormalizedLicensePlate` is the canonical plate identity.
- A PostgreSQL exclusion constraint prevents overlapping Pending/Confirmed rows for the same non-null SlotId over half-open planned intervals.
- Payment association and state must agree with its booking or session transition.
- Each persisted payable amount has exactly one correlated committed calculation log; preview calculations create none.

### 9.4 Entity Attributes

Attributes must satisfy DTO validation, domain rules, EF constraints, and database indexes. Incident reports contain structured identifiers and text description only. Pricing Policy scope is vehicle type, not building.

### 9.5 Data Dictionary

| Data item | Definition |
|---|---|
| PaymentStatus PAID | Successfully settled payment included in revenue |
| Booking SlotId | Optional concrete slot; car selection only in active booking behavior |
| Pricing Priority | Deterministic selection precedence exposed in manager UI |
| ImageIn/ImageOut | Gate images stored on parking session |

### 9.6 Data Constraints And Validation Rules

Required fields, numeric ranges, status transitions, uniqueness, normalized plates, foreign keys, soft-delete filters, booking exclusion, and DTO limits must be validated at the strongest practical boundary.

### 9.7 Data Ownership And Source Of Truth

PostgreSQL is the transactional data source. The API is the authoritative validation and authorization boundary. Browser-local authentication state is not authoritative. Current revenue is derived from Payment, not RevenueStatistic. Active pricing is derived from PricingPolicy and its rule graph through PricingEngine.

### 9.8 Data Lifecycle

Bookings progress through Section 13 states. Active sessions bind and later release resources. Payments retain Pending, Paid, or Failed state. Soft-deleted managed records remain logically unavailable.

### 9.9 Data Retention And Deletion

`[TBD]` Product, Legal, and Security must define retention and deletion periods for account data, gate images, plates, text incidents, pricing logs, audit logs, and payment metadata before production approval.

### 9.10 Data Migration

Deployments must apply migrations including `btree_gist` and booking exclusion before relying on concurrent slot protection. Refund and Monthly Subscription removal requires reviewed inventory, archival/mapping, backup, dependency-ordered migration, and rollback evidence. Grace Period remains active and must not be removed.

## 10. External Interface Requirements

> Last Updated: 2026-07-20 | Status: REVIEW | Author: PBMS Analysis Team

### 10.1 User Interface Requirements

Public routes provide home, direct login, registration, forgot password, and payment result. Driver, Staff, Manager, and Admin have role workspaces. The Driver navigation exposes `Parking & Booking`; its dashboard permits building/floor selection and direct navigation from an available mapped slot to the booking workspace. Incident reporting uses active type selection and text description only. The frontend exposes no login-OTP challenge, refund, Monthly Subscription, Notification, file evidence, automatic retry claim, Shift Report, or shift handover. ProtectedRoute improves navigation but does not replace server authorization.

### 10.2 Software Interface Requirements

- REST controllers use `/api` route prefixes and generally return `BaseResponse` envelopes.
- VNPay URLs and results use HMAC-SHA512 verification and minor-unit amounts.
- Plate Recognizer receives an image and region `vn`; highest confidence is the initial candidate.
- SMTP sends registration and recovery-purpose OTP email.
- Google identity supports existing-account login or verified registration.

### 10.3 Hardware Interface Requirements

PBMS uses browser media APIs for gate image capture. No automatic barrier, loop detector, printer, or dedicated card-reader protocol is specified by current code.

### 10.4 Communication Interface Requirements

Production communication must use HTTPS. CORS origins, frontend API base URL, JWT, VNPay, SMTP, Google, OCR, database, and optional cache settings must be supplied per environment. The frontend default `/api/v1` path must be reconciled with backend `/api` routes.

## 11. Non-Functional Requirements

> Last Updated: 2026-07-20 | Status: REVIEW | Author: PBMS Analysis Team

### 11.1 Non-Functional Requirement Catalogue

| ID | Category | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-SEC-001 | Credential/transport security | Must | REVIEW |
| NFR-SEC-002 | Server authorization | Must | REVIEW |
| NFR-PERF-001 | Web request timeout | Should | REVIEW |
| NFR-CON-001 | Booking concurrency | Must | REVIEW |
| NFR-TIME-001 | Time consistency | Must | REVIEW |
| NFR-AVAIL-001 | External degradation | Should | REVIEW |

| NFR-OBS-001 | Logging/audit | Should | REVIEW |
| NFR-PRIV-001 | Data retention | Must | REVIEW |
| NFR-REC-001 | Backup/recovery | Must | REVIEW |

### 11.2 Non-Functional Requirement Details

#### NFR-SEC-001 Credential And Transport Security

- **Statement**: In production, PBMS shall enforce HTTPS, validate JWT/VNPay signatures, retain BCrypt password hashing, and load secrets outside committed source configuration.
- **Priority**: Must
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Source**: REF-GEN-001, REF-GEN-002
- **Rationale**: Protect credentials, sessions, and financial callbacks in production.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Invalid signatures/tokens fail; no production secret is committed; rotation requires no code change.
- **Dependencies**: Deployment secret store and certificates.
- **Notes**: Current committed values require rotation.

#### NFR-SEC-002 Server-side Authorization

- **Statement**: For every non-public API operation, PBMS shall enforce authenticated role and ownership authorization on the server.
- **Priority**: Must
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Source**: REF-GEN-002
- **Rationale**: Prevent bypass of role and ownership boundaries.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Endpoint inventory tests reject anonymous, missing-permission, wrong-owner, and caller-supplied identity substitution; Admin mapping changes affect subsequent decisions without redeployment.
- **Dependencies**: FR-SEC-001, stable Permission codes, policy handler/provider, endpoint inventory, and permission-cache invalidation/versioning.
- **Notes**: Not currently satisfied; see RISK-SEC-001.

#### NFR-PERF-001 Interactive API Response

- **Statement**: When an ordinary web API request exceeds ten seconds, PBMS shall abort it and show a recoverable failure state.
- **Priority**: Should
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Source**: REF-GEN-001
- **Rationale**: Prevent the web interface from remaining indefinitely blocked by a stalled request.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Simulated delay aborts after configured timeout and clears busy UI.
- **Dependencies**: Web fetch wrapper.
- **Notes**: Automatic retry is excluded. The unused `retryAttempts` configuration must be removed; explicit user-triggered retry may remain.

#### NFR-CON-001 Booking Concurrency

- **Statement**: Under concurrent booking requests, PBMS shall persist at most one overlapping Pending or Confirmed interval for the same concrete slot.
- **Priority**: Must
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Source**: REF-GEN-002, REF-GEN-003
- **Rationale**: Preserve reservation integrity under races.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Race test commits at most one conflict candidate and reports the other deterministically.
- **Dependencies**: Booking exclusion migration.
- **Notes**: Broader zone capacity still needs application checks.

#### NFR-TIME-001 Time Consistency

- **Statement**: When calculating business-day pricing or revenue, PBMS shall use explicitly documented UTC+7 boundaries with consistent persisted timestamps.
- **Priority**: Must
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Source**: REF-GEN-002
- **Rationale**: Keep pricing, reporting, and shift results consistent at calendar boundaries.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: UTC-midnight boundary tests map to the expected Vietnam day in pricing and revenue.
- **Dependencies**: Clock/time-zone policy.
- **Notes**: Shift Report is excluded from the current release.

#### NFR-AVAIL-001 External Service Degradation

- **Statement**: When OCR, email, Google, or VNPay fails, PBMS shall return a controlled error without corrupting account, booking, session, or payment state.
- **Priority**: Should
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Source**: REF-GEN-001, REF-GEN-002
- **Rationale**: Isolate third-party failure from transactional state.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Fault-injection tests prove manual OCR fallback and unchanged invalid financial/identity state.
- **Dependencies**: External adapters.
- **Notes**: Notification and Shift Report behavior are outside the current release.

#### NFR-USAB-001 Responsive Role Workspace

- **Statement**: On supported desktop and mobile browser sizes, PBMS shall keep primary role actions usable and show validation, loading, success, and failure feedback.
- **Priority**: Should
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Source**: REF-GEN-001
- **Rationale**: Keep role workflows operable and understandable across supported screens.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Primary forms/tables retain mandatory controls and rejected actions show actionable feedback.
- **Dependencies**: Supported-browser decision.
- **Notes**: `[TBD]` Exact browser/version matrix.

#### NFR-OBS-001 Operational Traceability

- **Statement**: When a security-sensitive or operationally significant event occurs, PBMS shall record enough non-secret context to identify actor, time, object, action, and outcome.
- **Priority**: Should
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Source**: REF-GEN-002, REF-GEN-003
- **Rationale**: Support security review, incident diagnosis, and operational accountability.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Authentication failure, payment callback, privileged change, and worker failure can be diagnosed without secret leakage.
- **Dependencies**: Logging and audit persistence.
- **Notes**: After PRICE-02 remediation, committed payable calculations log exactly once; preview calculations do not persist logs.

#### NFR-PRIV-001 Data Retention

- **Statement**: Before production operation, PBMS shall enforce approved retention and deletion rules for personal, gate-image, payment, text-incident, pricing-log, and audit data.
- **Priority**: Must
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Source**: REF-GEN-004
- **Rationale**: Limit privacy and legal exposure from retained operational data.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Approved schedule maps each data class to retention, access, deletion/anonymization, and evidence.
- **Dependencies**: OQ-DATA-001.
- **Notes**: Not defined by current code.

#### NFR-REC-001 Backup And Recovery

- **Statement**: Before production operation, PBMS shall meet an approved database backup, restore, RPO, and RTO policy verified by a restore exercise.
- **Priority**: Must
- **Status**: REVIEW
- **Source**: REF-GEN-004
- **Rationale**: Ensure transactional data can be recovered after operational failure.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Approved RPO/RTO exist and a documented restore meets both.
- **Dependencies**: OQ-OPS-002 and deployment platform.
- **Notes**: `[TBD]` Targets are not present in code.

### 11.3 Performance

NFR-PERF-001 is the only current measurable client target. Server throughput and percentile latency remain `[TBD]` and must not be invented.

### 11.4 Availability

NFR-AVAIL-001 defines graceful external failure. Production service-level availability remains `[TBD]`.

### 11.5 Reliability

NFR-CON-001, idempotent payment handling, controlled rollback, and worker isolation form the current reliability baseline.

### 11.6 Scalability

The code supports paged queries in several modules, but no approved load or horizontal-scaling target exists.

### 11.7 Security

NFR-SEC-001 and NFR-SEC-002 are release-critical. Frontend role routes are defense-in-depth only.

### 11.8 Privacy

NFR-PRIV-001 blocks production approval until OQ-DATA-001 is resolved.

### 11.9 Usability

NFR-USAB-001 applies to role workspaces, camera fallback, forms, tables, and error states.

### 11.10 Maintainability

Clean Architecture boundaries, stable requirement IDs, typed API clients, tests, and centralized time/configuration should be retained. Duplicate pricing/time logic should be reconciled.

### 11.11 Compatibility And Portability

PBMS targets supported modern browsers and .NET 10/PostgreSQL deployment. Exact browser versions and production platform remain review items.

### 11.12 Accessibility

`[TBD]` No approved WCAG level or accessibility test baseline is evidenced by current sources.

### 11.13 Logging And Auditing

NFR-OBS-001 applies. Logs must not contain passwords, OTPs, JWTs, gateway secrets, or raw sensitive configuration.

### 11.14 Backup And Recovery

NFR-REC-001 applies.

### 11.15 Compliance

Applicable privacy, payment, accounting, and local operational obligations require Product/Legal review; none is inferred from code alone.

## 12. Access Control Requirements

> Last Updated: 2026-07-20 | Status: REVIEW | Author: PBMS Analysis Team

### 12.1 Authentication Requirements

- Public endpoints are limited to approved registration/login, necessary payment callbacks/returns, and explicitly public reference data.
- JWT identity must be validated before protected action.
- Caller identity must come from verified claims, not an arbitrary request `staffId`, `managerId`, or `accountId` when ownership matters.
- Password recovery requires a distinct, single-use, expiring recovery purpose.

### 12.2 Authorization Requirements

Accounts, AuditLogs, PricingPolicies, PricingEngine, and PenaltyConfigs currently show explicit authorization attributes. Many booking, session, facility, payment, revenue, incident, card, blacklist, and configuration operations do not. SubscriptionPriceConfigs must be removed. Notification and Shift Report endpoints must not be exposed. These implementation facts are gaps and do not weaken NFR-SEC-002.

The target authorization model retains Role, Permission, and RolePermission as active runtime data. Every non-public endpoint maps to a stable Permission code enforced by a server authorization policy. Admin alone manages RolePermission mappings. Resource ownership is checked separately from permission membership, and permission-cache changes must become effective without redeployment.

### 12.3 Access Control Matrix

| Resource/action | Driver | Staff | Manager | Admin | System |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Own vehicle/booking/session/payment read | Own | Operational need | Oversight | Oversight | - |
| Gate session create/checkout | - | X | [REVIEW] | [REVIEW] | - |
| Facility write | - | - | X | X | - |
| Pricing read/calculate | Authenticated as permitted | Authenticated as permitted | X | X | - |
| Pricing create/edit/activate | - | - | X | X | - |
| Pricing cleanup endpoint | - | - | X | X | Scheduled execution |
| Incident/card/blacklist | - | X | X | X | - |
| Audit logs | - | - | X | X | - |
| Account delete | - | - | - | X | - |

`[REVIEW]` cells require product confirmation, but absence of a decision does not authorize public access.

### 13.1 State Definitions

| Object | Active states represented by current behavior |
|---|---|
| Booking | Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled, Expired, CheckedIn, NoShow |

|---|---|---|---|
| Booking | Pending | Deposit paid | Confirmed |
| Booking | Pending | Deadline cleanup | Expired |
| Booking | Pending/Confirmed | Eligible cancel | Cancelled |
| Booking | Confirmed | Session created | CheckedIn |
| Booking | Confirmed | Grace cleanup | NoShow |
| Payment | Pending | Cash or verified VNPay | Paid |
| Payment | Pending | Superseded/rejected/expired | Failed |

## 14. Error Handling And Edge Cases

> Last Updated: 2026-07-20 | Status: REVIEW | Author: PBMS Analysis Team

### 14.1 Error Catalogue

| Error ID | Condition | Expected handling |
|---|---|---|
| ERR-AUTH-001 | Invalid/expired/locked OTP or token | Reject without creating/changing account |
| ERR-AUTH-002 | Invalid/expired/replayed recovery OTP or token | Reject without changing the password and return a non-enumerating controlled response |
| ERR-BOOK-001 | Timing, capacity, overlap, state, or owner invalid | Reject atomically with business error |
| ERR-OPS-001 | OCR/camera unavailable | Preserve manual plate path |
| ERR-OPS-002 | Plate/card/vehicle/slot conflict | Reject or enter authorized exception flow |
| ERR-PRICE-001 | No valid policy or invalid rule graph | Return controlled pricing failure; do not fabricate total |
| ERR-PAY-001 | Invalid VNPay signature or duplicate callback | Reject/idempotently preserve prior state |
| ERR-SYS-001 | Worker iteration fails | Log failure and continue recoverably on later cycle |

### 14.2 Edge Cases

- Time intervals crossing Vietnam midnight or multiple daily caps.
- Simultaneous concrete-slot bookings and simultaneous resource assignment.
- OCR plate formatting differs from stored plate formatting.
- Booking cancellation races with check-in or cleanup transition.
- Worker observes a record already transitioned by a user request.
- Recovery is requested for an unknown email; PBMS returns the same generic request response.
- Committed pricing fails after calculation but before persistence; no financial record or orphan calculation log is retained.
- Frontend constants disagree with backend validation; backend remains authoritative.

## 15. Acceptance Criteria And Verification

> Last Updated: 2026-07-20 | Status: REVIEW | Author: PBMS Analysis Team

### 15.1 Acceptance Criteria Catalogue

| AC group | Requirement scope | Minimum evidence |

| AC-PAY | FR-PAY-001..002 | Signature, idempotency, cash, and online payment tests plus refund-surface absence inspection |
| AC-RPT | FR-RPT-001, FR-AUD-001 | UTC+7 revenue, audit access tests, and inspection proving Notification/Shift Report absence |
| AC-NFR | All NFRs | Security scan/review, timeout/fault tests, restore exercise, manual UX evidence |

### 15.2 Verification Methods

| Method | Use |
|---|---|
| Unit test | Domain calculation and validation rules |
| Integration test | Controller, service, repository, migration, worker, and external adapter contracts |
| End-to-end test | Role workflows across web and API |
| Inspection | Source configuration, secrets, route/endpoint inventory, traceability |
| Demonstration | Camera fallback, responsive UI, role operations |
| Restore exercise | Backup/RPO/RTO verification |

All Must requirements require passing evidence or a formally approved exception before release. Current code presence alone is not acceptance evidence.

### 17.3 Requirement-Related Risks

| Risk ID | Severity | Description | Required disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| RISK-SEC-001 | Critical | Many operational controllers lack server authorization; frontend route guards are bypassable. | Add roles/ownership policies and full endpoint tests. |
| RISK-SEC-002 | Critical | Sensitive values are committed in API configuration. | Revoke/rotate and externalize before production. |
| RISK-AUTH-001 | Medium | Login-OTP code may still be visible or reachable after direct-JWT scope decision. | Remove frontend branch and hide future backend endpoint from release API surface. |
| RISK-AUTH-002 | High | Forgot-password UI calls an absent reset endpoint and incompatible registration OTP path. | Design and implement recovery end-to-end. |
| RISK-SHIFT-001 | Medium | Shift Report backend or route may remain exposed despite release exclusion. | Remove frontend surface and disable/hide backend exposure under SHIFT-01. |
| RISK-API-001 | High | Frontend base may use `/api/v1` while backend routes use `/api`. | Require validated deployment base URL. |
| RISK-BOOK-001 | Medium | Some frontend timing constants differ from backend rules. | Consume backend config or align UI validation/text. |
| RISK-PRICE-001 | High | Legacy fee service applies Grace Period while the active PricingEngine does not. | Port Grace Period, establish parity, then retire duplicate fee behavior. |
| RISK-PRICE-002 | High | Booking payable amounts may be persisted without a correlated PricingCalculationLog. | Implement transactional committed-calculation logging and idempotency tests. |
| RISK-INC-001 | High | Driver session ownership and active Incident Type eligibility may not be enforced server-side. | Enforce ownership and active-type validation while keeping all active types visible. |
| RISK-INC-002 | Low | Driver UI still implies file evidence is uploaded although only text is submitted. | Remove file control and all evidence-upload claims. |
| RISK-LEG-001 | High | Refund and Monthly Subscription code/schema may survive the removal decision. | Execute reviewed code cleanup and dependency-ordered data migration. |
| RISK-NOTIF-001 | Medium | Notification-only workers may keep writing records inaccessible to users. | Disable worker registration and exclude Notification from active release model. |
| RISK-WEB-001 | Low | Client `retryAttempts` remains declared despite removal decision. | Remove the unused setting and retry claims. |

### 18.1 Glossary

The normative compact glossary is Section 1.4. Domain status names use code spelling in state models and uppercase normalized spelling when describing payment semantics.

### 18.2 Diagrams

- `Diagrams/PBMS_Business_Analysis_Simplified.md` is the summary layout and diagram index.
- `Diagrams/PBMS_Business_Analysis.md` contains detailed process, ERD, rule, and gap diagrams.
- In those diagrams, PBMS denotes synchronous system processing; System denotes the named non-human workers.

### 18.3 Supporting Documents

- `Diagrams/PBMS_Feature_Actor_Based.md`
- `Software-Requirements-Specification-Kit/Agent/AGENTS.md`
- `Software-Requirements-Specification-Kit/Context/SRS-TOC.md`

## 20. Requirement Status Convention

> Last Updated: 2026-07-20 | Status: REVIEW | Author: PBMS Analysis Team

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| DRAFT | Being authored and not ready for formal review |
| REVIEW | Evidence-aligned and awaiting human review/approval |
| APPROVED | Explicitly accepted by authorized human reviewers |
| DEPRECATED | Retained for traceability but not an active acceptance target |

Priority uses Must, Should, Could, and Won't. This document does not assign APPROVED automatically. `[TBD]`, `[REVIEW]`, `[CONFLICT]`, and `[ASSUMPTION]` markers identify unresolved content without inventing facts.
